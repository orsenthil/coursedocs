CourseDocs
==========

This site has documentation, notes, reference materials for various online courses.  This started as a website for
OMSCS_ material, still contains majority of notes from those, but has included other useful and interesting online
courses too.


General Principles
------------------

* Preferably be no repetition of the content. If the content can be referenced by link to the parent site, a link
  should be provided.
* Content should be useful as a reference material. Watching videos take time, docs are easier to read and skim through.
* No Assignment Solutions. Hints to approach is alright.
