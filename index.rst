Courses
=======

Reference materials for the courses that I have taken.

General Principles
------------------

* Preferably no repetition of the content. If the content can be referenced by
  link to the parent site, a link should be provided.

* Content should be useful as a reference material. Watching videos take time,
  docs are easier to read and skim through.

* No Assignment Solutions.

Helpful Repositories and Tools

**Numpy Helpers**

Number of courses require familiarity with Numpy. I gathered a bunch of useful,
small numpy programs for reference.
