1 - Lesson Preview
==================
Up to this point, we mentioned
synchronization multiple times while
discussing other operating
system concepts.
In this lesson, we will primarily
focus on synchronization.
We will discuss several
synchronization constructs,
what are the benefits of
using those constructs.
And also we will discuss what is the
hardware level support that's necessary
in order for those synchronization
primitives to be implemented.
As we cover these concepts,
we will use the paper,
The Performance of Spin Lock
Alternatives by Thomas Anderson.
This paper will give you a deeper
understanding of how are synchronization
constructs implemented on top
of the underlying hardware, and
why they exhibits certain
performance strengths.
There is a link to the paper
available in the instructors notes.

2 - Visual Metaphor
===================
Let's illustrate synchronization and
synchronization mechanisms using our toy
shop example, synchronization in
operating systems is like waiting for
a co-worker in the toy shop to finish so
that you can continue working.
When an elf is waiting on a co-worker
to finish, several things can happen,
the elf can continuously check
whether the other elf is done or
they can ask the co-worker to
signal them once they are done.
At any rate, the time that an elf spends
waiting will hurt the performance of
the toy shop, for instance the elf
may repeatedly check the other
elf whether it's completed the work,
asking questions like, are you done now?
What about now?
Are you still working?
This can have a negative
impact on the elf
that is working because it will delay
its processing, he will be annoyed.
The second approach of hey, I'm done
you can come and do your work now
is maybe a little bit more laid back but
this other guy may have gone out for
lunch in the meantime so it may take
it longer to actually come back and
precede with the execution with
the processing of the toy.
So regardless, in both of these cases
the workers are wasting some productive
time during this wait period,
similar analogies to these exist in
synchronization in operating systems.
Processes may repeatedly check
whether it's okay for them to continue
using a construct called spinlocks
that's supported in operating systems.
We already talked about mutexes and
condition variables and
we saw that they can be used in order to
implement this behavior where a process
waits for a signal from another process
before it can continue working.
Regardless of how we wait, and
which synchronization mechanism we use,
this will affect performance, this can
result in CPU cycles that are wasted
when we're performing this checking or
performance may be lost due to
certain cache effects when
we are signalling another
process that was periodically blocked
to come back and start executing again.

3 - More About Synchronization
==============================
We spend already quite a bit of time
talking about dealing with concurrency
in multi-threaded programs.
We explained mutexes and
condition variables,
both in generic terms based
on Birrell's paper, and
also their specific APIs and
usage in the context of Pthreads.
You're probably all safe and
well underway with writing your Pthread
programs using these constructs.
So you're probably
asking yourselves now,
why do we have to talk more
about synchronization?
We spent quite a bit of time
already talking about it and
gained experience with it.
Well, as we discussed mutexes and
condition variables we mentioned
a number of common pitfalls.
This included things like
forgetting to unlock the mutex, or
signalling the wrong
condition variables.
These issues are an indication
that the use of mutexes and
condition variables is not
an error-proof process.
What that means is that these
errors may affect the correctness
of programs that use mutexes and
condition variables.
And in general it will affect the ease
of use of these two
synchronization constructs.
Also, in the examples that we discussed,
we had to introduce some helper
variables when we needed to express
invariance to control a reader's
writer access to a shared file.
We also need helper variables to deal
with certain priority restrictions,
given that mutexes or
condition variables don't inherently
allow us to specify anything
regarding priority.
This implies that these
constructs lack expressive power.
We cannot easily express with them
arbitrary synchronization conditions.
Finally, mutexes and condition variables
and any other software synchronization
construct requires a lower
level support from the hardware
in order to guarantee the correctness
of the synchronization construct.
Hardware provides this type of low
level support via atomic instructions.
So these are some of
the reasons why it makes
sense to spend more time
talking about synchronization.
What we will do, we will look
at few other constructs, some of
which eliminate some of the issues
with mutexes and condition variables.
And also we will talk
about different types of
views the underlying
atomic instructions,
to achieve efficient implementations
of certain synchronization constructs.

4 - Spinlocks
=============
One of the most basic synchronization
constructs that's commonly supported in
an operating system is spinlock.
In some ways,
spinlocks are similar to a mutex.
The lock is used to protect the critical
section to provide mutual exclusion
among potentially multiple threads or
processes that are trying to
perform this critical section.
And it has certain constructs that
are equivalent to the lock and
unlock constructs that
we saw with mutexes.
The use of these lock and
unlock operations is similar
to the case of the mutexes.
If the lock is free,
then we can acquire it and
proceed with the execution
of the critical section.
And if the lock is not free, we will be
suspended at this particular point and
unable to go on.
The way spinlocks differ than mutexes,
however, is that when the lock is busy,
the thread that's suspended in its
execution at this particular point of
time isn't blocked, like in the case of
mutexes, but instead, it is spinning.
It is running on the CPU and
repeatedly checking to see
whether this lock became free.
With mutexes, the thread would have
relinquished the CPU and allowed for
another thread to run.
With spinlocks, the thread will spin.
It will burn CPU cycles until
the lock becomes free or
until the thread gets preempted for
some reason.
For instance, maybe it was spinning
until ultimately its time slice expired,
or potentially a higher
priority thread became runable.
Because of their simplicities, spinlocks
are a basic synchronization primitive,
and they can be used to
implement more complex,
more sophisticated
synchronization constructs.
Because they're a basic construct,
we will revisit spinlocks a little bit
later in this lesson, and we will spend
some time discussing different
implementation strategies for spinlocks.

5 - Semaphores
==============
The next construct we will
talk about is semaphores, and
these are a common synchronization
constructs that have been part of
operating system kernels for a while.
As a first approximation, a semaphore
acts like a traffic semaphore.
It either allows threads to go or
it will block them.
It will stop them from
proceeding any further.
This is in some ways similar to
what we saw in, with the mutex.
It either allows a thread
to obtain the lock and
proceed with the critical section,
or the thread is blocked and
has to wait for
the mutex to become free.
However, semaphores are more general
than just this behavior that can be
obtained with a mutex, and
we will take a look at how,
what exactly a semaphore is
a bit more formally next.
Semaphores are represented
via an integer number,
some positive integer value.
When they're initialized,
they're assigned some maximum value,
some positive integer.
Threads arriving at
the semaphore will try it out.
If the semaphore's value is non-zero,
they will decrement it and proceed.
If it is zero,
then they will have to wait.
This means that the number of threads
that will be allowed to proceed
will equal this maximum value that
was used when the semaphore was first
initialized.
So as a synchronization construct,
one of the benefits of semaphores
is that they'll allow us to express
count-related synchronization
requirements.
For instance, five producers may be able
to produce an item at the same time.
The semaphore will be initialized with
the number five, and then it will count
and make sure that exactly five
producers are allowed to proceed.
It a semaphore is initialized with one,
then its behavior will be
equivalent to a mutex.
It will be a binary semaphore.
All threads that are leaving
the critical section will
post to the semaphore or
signal the semaphore.
What that will do, it will
increment the semaphore's counter.
For a binary semaphore,
this is equivalent to unlocking a mutex.
Finally, some historic tidbits.
Semaphores were originally
designed by Dijkstra.
He was a Dutch computer scientist and
also a Turing Award winner.
And the wait and post operations that
are used with semaphores were referred
to as P and V, and P and
V come from the Dutch words proberon,
which means to test out, to try, and
verhogen, which means to increase.
So if you ever see a semaphore
used with operations P and
V, you will now know what that means.

6 - POSIX Semaphores
====================
Here's some of the operations that
are part of the Posix Semaphore API.
Semaphore.h defines
the sem_t semaphore type.
Initializing a semaphore is
done with the sem_init code.
This takes as a parameter of
semaphore beta type variable and
also it takes the initialization
count and a flag.
This flag will indicate whether
the semaphore is shared by
threads within a single process or
across processes.
The sem_wait and
sem_post operations take as a parameter
the semaphore variable that
was previously initialized.

7 - Mutex Via Semaphore Quiz
============================
As a quick quiz, complete the arguments
in the initialization routine for
a semaphore.
So that the use of the semaphore
is identical in its behavior
to that of a mutex that is used by
threads within a single process.
A reference link to the semaphore
API has been included
in the instructor notes.

8 - Mutex Via Semaphore Quiz Solution
=====================================
To use a semaphore in this manner,
you should initialize the semaphore so
that it is a non-process
shared semaphore.
So, this argument to
the initialization call should be 0.
And so that its initial count is 1.
So this argument will be 1.
Then, when the semaphore
wait operation is called.
It will decrement this counter and it
will allow exactly one thread at a time
to enter the critical section and
posting to a semaphore will increment
the counter and it will be
identical to a mutex being freed.
Note that most operating systems
textbooks will include some examples on
how to implement one synchronization
construct with another
including mutexes or
condition variables with semaphores.
And there are many other examples.
So you're welcome to experiment on
your own with these kinds of examples.

9 - Reader Writer Locks
=======================
When specifying
synchronization requirements,
it is sometimes useful to distinguish
among the different types of accesses
that a resource can be accessed with.
For instance,
we commonly want to distinguish
those accesses that don't
modify a shared resource,
like reading, versus those accesses
that do modify a shared resource.
Like writing.
For the first type of accesses,
the resource can be shared concurrently.
For the second type of accesses,
we require exclusive access.
For this reason, operating systems and
language run times as well supports so
called Reader/Writer Locks.
You can define Reader/Writer Locks and
use them in a way that's
similar to a mutex.
How ever you always specify
the type of access,
read versus write that
you want to perform.
And then underneath the lock
behaves accordingly.

10 - Using Reader Writer Locks
==============================
In Linux, you can define a reader
writer lock by using the provided
data type for reader writer locks.
To access a shared resource
using this reader writer lock,
you use the appropriate interface,
read lock or write lock.
Which one you use will clearly
depend on the kind of operation that
you want to perform in
the shared resource.
The reader writer API also provides the
corresponding unlock counterparts for
both read and write.
A few other operations are supported
on reader writer locks, but
these are the primary ones.
And if you would like to explore more,
then take a look at the .h file.
We are providing a link to it
in the instructor's notes.
Reader writer locks are supported
in many operating systems and
language run times.
In some of these contexts, the reader
writer operations are referred to as
shared locks and exclusive locks.
However, certain aspects of
the behavior of the reader writer locks
are different in terms
of their semantics.
For instance,
it makes sense to permit a recursive
read_lock operations to be invoked.
But then,
it differs across implementations, and
exactly what happens on read_unlock.
In some cases, a single read_unlock may
unlock every single one of the read_lock
operations that have recursively been
invoked from within the same thread.
Whereas in other implementations,
a separate read_unlock is required for
every single read_lock operation.
Another way in which implementations
of reader writer locks differ is
in their treatment of priorities.
For instance in some cases, a reader,
so an owner of a shared lock,
may be given a priority
to upgrade the lock.
So from a reader lock to
convert to a writer lock.
Compared to a newly arriving request for
a write lock, or an exclusive lock.
In other implementations,
that's not the case.
So the owner of a read lock
will first release it and
then try to re-acquire it with
write access permissions.
And contend with any other thread that's
trying to perform the same operation.
Another priority related
difference across
reader writer lock implementations
is what kind of interaction is there
between the state of the lock,
the priority of the threads, and the
scheduling policy in the system overall.
For instance it could block a reader so
a thread that otherwise would
have been allowed to proceed.
If there is already a writer
that has higher priority and
that is waiting on that lock.
In this case the writer is waiting
because there are other threads that
already have read access to the lock.
And if there is a coupling
between the scheduling policy and
the synchronization mechanisms,
it's possible that a newly
arriving reader will be blocked.
It will not be allowed to join the other
readers in the critical section.
Because of the fact that the waiting
writer has higher priority.

11 - Monitors
=============
One of the problems with
the constructs that we saw so
far is that they require developers
to pay attention to the use
of the peer-wise operations,
lock/unlock, wait signal and others.
And this, as you can imagine, is one
of the important causes of errors.
Monitors, on the other hand,
are a higher-level synchronization
construct that helps with this problem.
In an abstract way, the monitors will
explicitly specify what is the resource
that's being protected by
the synchronization construct.
What are all the possible entry
procedures to that resource, like, for
instance, if we have to differentiate
between readers and writers?
And also, it would explicitly
specify any condition variables that
could potentially be used to wake up
different types of waiting threads.
When performing certain types of access
on entry, all the necessary locking and
checking will take place when
the thread is entering the monitor.
Similarly, when the thread is
done with the shared resource and
it's exiting the monitor,
all of the necessary unlock operations,
checks, any of the signaling that's
necessary for the condition variables,
all of that will happen automatically,
will be hidden from the programmer.
Because of all of this,
monitors are referred to as
a high-level synchronization construct.
Historically, monitors were included
in the MESA language runtime
developed by Xerox PARC.
Today, Java supports monitors too.
Every single object in Java has
an internal lock, and methods that
are declared to be synchronized
are entry points into this monitor.
When complied,
the resulting code will include all of
the appropriate locking and checking.
The only thing is that notify
has to be done explicitly.
Monitors also refer to the programming
style that uses mutexes and condition
variables to describe the entry and
exit codes from the critical section.
And this is what we described in
the threads and concurrency lesson with
the enter critical section and
exit critical section section sub code.

12 - More Synchronization Constructs
====================================
In addition to the multiple
synchronization constructs
that we already saw, there are many
other options available out there.
Some, like serializers,
make it easier to define priorities and
then also hide the need for
explicit signaling and
explicit use of condition
variables from the programmers.
Others, like path expressions, require
that a programmer specify the regular
expression that captures the correct
synchronization behavior.
So as opposed to using locks or
other constructs,
the programmer would specify something
like many reads or a single write.
And the runtime will make sure that the
way the operations are interleaved that
are accessing the shared resource
satisfy that particular regular
expression.
Another useful construct are barriers,
and
these are almost like a reverse from
a semaphore in that if a semaphore
will allow n threads to proceed
before it blocks, a barrier will
block all threads until n threads
arrive at this particular point.
Rendezvous points is also a
synchronization construct that waits for
multiple threads to meet that
particular point in execution.
Also for scalability and efficiency,
there are efforts to achieve concurrency
without explicitly locking and waiting.
These approaches all fall in a category
that we refer to as wait-free
synchronization.
And they're optimistic in the sense
that they bet on the fact that
there won't be any conflicts
due to concurrent writes and
it's safe to allow reads
to proceed concurrently.
An example that falls into this category
is this so-called read-copy update log,
RCU log,
that's part of the Linux kernel.
One thing that all of these methods have
in common is that at the lowest level,
they all require some support from the
underlying hardware to atomically make
updates to a memory location.
This is the only way they can actually
guarantee that the lock is properly
required, and that the state change
is performed in a way that is safe.
And that it doesn't lead
to any race conditions, and
that all threads in the system are in an
agreement of what exactly is the current
state of the synchronization construct.
We will spend the remainder
of this lesson discussing
how synchronization construct can be
built using directly the hardware
support that's available from
the underlying platform.
And we will specifically focus
on spinlocks as the simplest
construct out there.

13 - Sync Building Block  Spinlock
==================================
We said that spinlocks are one of the
most basic synchronization primitives.
And that they're also used in creating
some more complex synchronization
constructs.
For that reason it makes sense to
focus the remainder of this lesson
on understanding how exactly
spinlocks can be implemented.
And what types of opportunities
are available for
their efficient implementation.
To do this, we will follow the paper The
Performance of Spin Lock Alternatives
on Shared Memory Multiprocessors
by Tom Anderson.
The paper discusses different
implementations of spinlocks and
this is relevant also for
other synchronization constructs
that use internally spinlocks.
Also some of the techniques that
are described in this paper that concern
the use of atomic instructions
generalize to other constructs and
other situations.

14 - Spinlock Quiz 1
====================
As a quiz, let's look at a possible
spinlock implementation.
Here is a possible pseudo code.
To be clear, the lock needs to be
initialized as free and that will be 0.
And 1 will indicate
that the lock is busy.
To lock the spinlock,
we first need to check to make
sure that the lock is free.
And if so, then we can change
its state and block it.
So change its state to busy.
Otherwise, if the lock isn't free,
we have to keep spinning.
So we have to keep repeating
this check and this operation.
Finally, releasing the lock means that
we set the value of the lock to free.
These steps are listed
in the Instructor Notes.
The questions in this quiz are does
the implementation of the lock
correctly guarantee mutual exclusion?
Also, is this implementation efficient?
Mark your answers here.

15 - Spinlock Quiz 1 Solution
=============================
Before we talk about the correctness
of the mutual exclusion,
let's take a look at
the efficiency factor.
So this goto spin statement, as long as
the lock is not free, this means that
this cycle will repeatedly be executed
and this will waste CPU resources.
Therefore, from efficiency standpoint,
this is not an efficient implementation.
It's inefficient.
But efficiency aside,
this solution is also incorrect.
In an environment where we have multiple
threads that execute concurrently, or
multiple processes,
it is possible that more than one thread
will see at the same
time that lock is free.
And they will move on to
perform this lock equal busy
operation at the same time.
Only one thread will actually set
the lock value to busy correctly.
The other one will simply override
it and will then proceed.
It will think that it has
correctly acquired the lock.
So as a result, both processes or
both threads can end up in the critical
section and that clearly is incorrect.

16 - Spinlock Quiz 2
====================
Here's another slightly different
version of the same implementation
that avoids the go to statement.
As long as the lock is busy,
the thread will keep spinning,
it will remain in this while loop.
At some point, when the log becomes
free, the thread will exit from this
while loop, and it will set the lock
value to busy, so as to acquire it.
Now answer the same question
as in the previous quiz.
Is this implementation of a spinlock
correct in terms of its ability to
guarantee mutual exclusion, and also,
is this an efficient implementation?

17 - Spinlock Quiz 2 Solution
=============================
Again, as in the previous case,
this implementation will be
both inefficient and incorrect.
The inefficiency comes from
the fact that again we have
continuous loop that is spinning
as long as the lock is busy.
Now, the implementation
is incorrect because
although we did put
this while check here,
multiple threads again will see that
the lock is free once it becomes free.
They will exit this while loop and
will move on here and
try to set the lock value to be busy.
If these threads are allowed
to execute concurrently,
there's absolutely no way purely in
software to guarantee that there
won't be some interleaving of exactly
how these threads perform this
check in these set operations and that
a race condition will not occur here.
We can try to come up with
multiple purely software-based
implementations of a spinlock.
And we'll ultimately come to the same
conclusion that we need some kind of
support from the hardware in order to
make sure that some of this checking and
setting of the lock value happens
atomically via hardware support.

18 - Need for Hardware Support
==============================
So we need to get some
help from the hardware,
looking at this spinlock example
from the previous video.
We somehow needed the checking
of the lock value and
the setting of the lock value to happen
indivisibly, atomically, so that we
can guarantee that only one thread at
a time can successfully obtain the lock.
The problem with this implementation is
that it takes multiple cycles to perform
the check in this setting and
during these multiple cycles,
threads can be interleaved
in arbitrary ways.
If they're running on
multiple processors,
their execution can
completely overlap in time.
To make this work,
we have to rely on support from
hardware-supported atomic instructions

19 - Atomic Instructions
========================
Each type of hardware or
hardware architecture will support
a number of atomic instructions.
Some examples include test and set, or
read and increment, or compare and swap.
Different instructions may be supported
on different hardware platforms.
Not every architecture has to
support every single one of
the available atomic
instructions out there.
As you can tell from the names
of these instructions,
they all perform some multi-step,
multi-cycle operation.
But, because they're
atomic instructions,
the hardware makes
guarantees that the set
of operations that are included in these
instructions will happen atomically,
so not just halfway,
the entire operation or none of it.
That it will happen in mutual exclusion,
meaning that only one
instruction at a time will be allowed
to perform the appropriate operation.
And that the remaining ones will
be queued up, will have to wait.
So if we think about this, what this
means is that the atomic instructions
specify some operation, and
this operation is the critical section.
And the hardware supports all of the
synchronization-related mechanisms that
are required for that operation.
If you look at our spin lock example,
using the first atomic test and
set up operation, the spin lock
implementation can look as follows.
Here test is set to automatically
returns or tests the original value
of the memory locations that's past
this parameter, lock in this case.
And sets the new value of this
memory location to be one.
This happens automatically.
Remember, one, to us,
indicates that the lock is busy.
When we have multiple threads that
are contending for this lock,
when they are trying to execute
this spinlock operation,
only one needs to
successfully wire the lock.
The very first thread that comes
to execute the test and set.
For that thread, test and
set will return zero because
the original value of the lock was zero.
Originally, the lock was free.
That thread will
therefore exit the Y loop
because test_and_set will return zero,
read, and that is different than busy.
Why?
That is the only thread that
will acquire the log and
proceed with the execution.
All of the remaining threads that
try to execute test_and_set, or
then test_and_set will return one,
because this first thread already
set the value of lock to be one.
Therefore, those remaining threads
will just continue spinning
into this wild loop.
Notice that in the process,
these other threads,
they're repeatedly resetting
the value of the lock to one.
So as they're spinning
through the while loop,
every single time they try to
execute this test_and_set operation,
this sets the value of lock field
to be one again and to be busy.
However, that's okay.
The very first thread,
when it executed test_and_set,
they already set the value
of the log to be busy.
And these other threads are not
really changing the fact that the log
is indeed locked.
Which specific atomic instructions
are available on a given platform
varies from hardware to hardware.
Some operations like test and
set, others like read and
increment may not be
available on all platforms.
And in fact we may have versions of
this, where in some cases there is
availability of an atomic operation
that anatomically increments something
that does not necessarily
return the old value.
In other cases, there may be atomics
that support read_and_decrement as
opposed to read_and_increment.
In addition, there may be differences
in efficiencies with which
different atomic operations execute
on different architectures.
For this reason, software such
as synchronization constructs
that are built using certain atomic
constructions has to be ported.
We have to make sure that
the implementation actually uses
one of the atomic constructions that's
available on the target platform.
Also we have to make sure that
the implementation of software of
these synchronizations
constructs is optimized so
that use the most efficient
atomicity on our target platform.
And so that it uses them in
an efficient way to begin with.
Anderson's paper presents several
alternatives in how spinlocks can be
implemented using available
hardware atomics, and
we will discuss these in
the remainder of this lecture.

20 - Shared Memory Multiprocessors
==================================
Before moving on with the discussion
of the spin lock alternatives that
are presented in Anderson's paper,
let's do a refresh on multiprocessor
systems and
our cache coherence mechanisms.
This is necessary in order to
understand the design trade-offs and
the performance trends that will
be discussed in this paper.
A multiprocessor system
consists of more than one CPU.
In some memory that is
accessible to all of these CPUs.
The shared memory may be
a single memory component that's
equidistant from all of the CPUs.
Or there will be multiple
memory components.
Regardless of the number
of memory components,
they are somehow
interconnected to the CPUs.
And in this figure, I'm showing
an interconnect based connection.
And this is more common
in current systems.
Or a bus-based connection, which
was really more common in the past.
Also note, here I'm drawing
the bus-based connection to apply to
a configuration where there is
only a single memory module.
However, the bus-based configuration can
apply to both of these situations and
vice versa.
The one difference is that in
the interconnect base configuration,
I can have multiple memory
references in flight.
Where one memory reference is
applied to this memory module and
another one to the other memory module.
Whereas if I have a bus-based
configuration in this case,
the shared bus, only one memory
reference at a time can be in flight.
Regardless of whether these references
are addressing a single memory module or
are spread out across
multiple memory modules.
So the bus is basically shared
across all the modules.
Because of this property that
the memory's accessible to all CPUs,
these systems are called
shared memory multiprocessors.
Other terms used to refer to shared
memory multiprocessors are also
symmetric multiprocessors,
or for short, SMPs.
In addition, each of the CPUs in these
kinds of systems can have caches.
Access to the cached data is faster so
caches are useful to
hide the memory latency.
The memory latency is even more of
an issue in shared memory systems
because there is contention
on the memory module.
Because of this contention, certain
memory references have to be delayed.
And that adds to the memory
latency even more so than before.
So it is as if the memory is
further away from the CPUs
because of this contention effect.
So when data is present in the cache,
the CPUs will read data from the cache
instead of memory, and
that will have an impact on performance.
Now when CPUs perform a write,
several things can happen.
First, you may not even allow
a write to happen to the cache.
A write will directly go to memory and
any cached copy of that particular
memory location will be invalidated.
Second, the CPU write may be
applied both to the cached
location as well as directly in memory.
So this technique is
called write-through.
We write both in the cache,
as well as in memory.
And finally, on some architectures
the write can be applied in cache.
But the actual update to the appropriate
memory location can be delayed and
applied later.
For instance, when that
particular cache line is evicted.
We call this the write-back.

21 - Cache Coherence
====================
One challenge is,
what happens when multiple CPUs
reference the same data, x in this case?
The data could appear
in multiple caches.
Or in this case when we have
multiple memory modules,
x is actually present in one
of the memory modules, but
both of the CPUs referenced it, and so
it appears in both of their caches.
On some architectures, this is a problem
that has to be dealt with purely in
software, otherwise the caches
will be not coherent.
For instance, if on one CPU we update x
to be 3, the hardware is not going to do
anything about the fact that the value
of x in the cache of another CPU is 4.
This will have to be fixed in software.
These are called
non-cache-coherent architectures.
On other platforms, however,
the hardware will take care of
all of the necessary steps to make
sure that the caches are coherent.
So, when one CPU updates x to be 3,
the hardware will make sure that the
cache on the other CPU is also updated.
These are called
cache-coherent platforms.
The basic methods that are used in
managing the cache coherence are called
write-invalidate and write-update.
Let's see what happens with each of
these methods when we have a situation
where a certain value is
present in all of the caches
on these two different platforms.
In the red invalidate case,
if one CPU changes the value of x,
then the hardware will make sure that
if any other cache has cashed that
particular variable x,
that value will be invalidated.
Future references on this
CPU to that same value x
will result in a cache miss and
will be pushed over to memory.
The memory location clearly
has to be updated based on
one of the methods write-through or
write-back.
In the write-update case, when one CPU
changes the value of x to x prime,
then the hardware makes sure that
if any other cache has cached that
same memory location,
its value gets updated as well,
as the name of this method suggests.
Subsequent accesses to this memorial
occasion from the other CPU will
result in a cache hit and will return
the correctly updated new value.
The trade off is that with
write-invalidate, we actually post lower
bandwidth requirements on the shared
interconnecting the system.
This is because we don't actually
have to send the full value of x,
just its address so that it can
be invalidated in other caches.
Plus once the cache line is invalidated,
future modifications to the same memory
location will not result in
subsequent invalidations,
that location is already invalidated.
So if the data isn't needed on any of
the other CPUs anytime soon, it is
possible to amortize the cost of the
coherence traffic over multiple changes.
So basically,
x will change multiple times over here,
before it's needed on the other CPU.
And it's only going to
be invalidated once.
That's what we mean by
this amortized cost.
For write-update architectures,
the benefit is that the data will be
available immediately on the other
CPUs that need to access it.
We will not have to pay the cost
to perform another memory access
in order to retrieve
the latest value of x.
So then, clearly programs that will need
to access the value of x immediately
after it has been updated on another
CPU will benefit from support for
a write-update.
Note that you as a programmer,
you don't really have a choice
in whether you will use write-update or
write-invalidate.
This is a property of
the hardware architecture, and
whichever policy the hardware uses,
you will be stuck with it.

22 - Cache Coherence and Atomics
================================
One thing that's important to
explain is what exactly happens with
cache coherence when atomic
instructions are used.
Recall that the purpose of atomic
instructions is to deal with issues that
are related to the arbiter intereleaving
of threads that are sharing the CPU,
as well as threads that are concurrently
executing across multiple CPUs.
Let's consider the following situation.
We have two CPUs.
On both of these CPUs we'll need to
perform some atomic instruction that
involves the memory location of x.
And this x has been cached
in both of the CPUs.
The problem, then, is how to prevent
multiple threads on these different CPUs
to concurrently access
the cashed values of x.
If we allow the atomic constructions
to read and update the cash value of
the memory reference, that's the the
target of the atomic construction.
There can be multiple problems.
We have multiple CPUs with caches and
we don't know where that
value has been cached.
We have write update versus
write invalidate protocols,
we have latency on the chip.
Given all these issues,
it's really challenging
if a particular atomic is
applied to the cache on one CPU.
To know whether or
not on another CPU another atomic
is attempted against
the cash value in that CPU.
For that reason,
atomic operations bypass the caches, and
they always directly
access the memory location
where the particular
target variable is stored.
By forcing all atomics to go directly to
the memory controller, this is going to
create a central entry point where all
of these references can be ordered and
synchronized in a unique matter.
So none of the rates conditions
that could have occurred if
we allowed atomics to access the cache,
that just won't occur in this situation.
This will solve the correctness problem,
but it will raise another issue.
Atomics will take longer than
other types of instructions.
We will always have to access memory and
they will also content on memory.
In addition in order to
guarantee atomic behavior,
we have to generate the coherence
traffic and either update or
invalidate all of the cached
copies of this memory reference.
Even if the value of this memory
location doesn't change with the atomic
operation.
We still have to perform this step
on enforcing coherence traffic, so
either invalidating or forcing the same
value to be reapplied to the cache,
regardless of whether or
not this location changes.
This is necessary in order to
stay on the side of safety and
to be able to guarantee correctness
of the atomic operations.
In summary, atomic instructions on SMP
systems are more expensive compared
to on a single CPU system, because
there will be some contention for
the shared bus or
the shared interconnect.
In addition,
atomics in general are more expensive,
because they will bypass the cache,
in these kinds of environments.
And they will trigger all the coherence
traffic, regardless to what happens
with the memory allocation that's
the target of the atomic instruction

23 - Spinlock Performance Metrics
=================================
With this background on SMPs,
cash coherence, and atomics,
we're now finally ready
to discuss the design and
performance trends of
spinlock implementations.
The only one thing that's left to decide
are what are the performance metrics
that are useful when reasoning about
different implementations of spinlocks.
To determine this, we should ask
ourselves, what are our objectives?
First we want the spinlock
to have low latency.
By latency, we are referring to how
long does it take for a thread to.
Acquire a lock when it's free, ideally
we want the thread to be able to acquire
a free lock immediately with
a single instruction, and
we already established that spinlocks
require atomic instructions.
So the ideal case will be that,
we just want to be able to execute a
single atomic instructions and be done.
Next we want the spinlock to have low
delay, or to have low waiting time.
What that means is that whenever it
is spinning and a lock becomes free,
is we want to reduce that time that it
takes from the thread to stop spinning
and to acquire that lock
that has just been freed.
Again ideally,
we would like for the thread to the able
to do that, as soon as possible,
as soon as this lock is freed, for
a thread to be able to acquire it.
So to execute an atomic.
And finally, we need a design that
will non generate contention.
On the shared bus or
the shared network interconnect.
By contention,
we mean both the contention that's
due to the actual atomic memory
references as well as contention that's
generated due to the coherence traffic.
Contention is bad because it will delay
any other CPU in the system that's
trying to access the memory, but
more importantly it will also delay
the owner of the spinlock and.
That is the thread, that is the process
that's trying to quickly complete
a critical section and
then release the spinlock.
So if we have a contention situation,
we may potentially even be delaying
the unlock operation for this spinlock.
That will clearly impact
performance even more.
So these are the three objectives
that we want to achieve in
a good spinlock design.
And the different alternatives that we
will discuss in this lesson will be
evaluated based on these criteria.

24 - Conflicting Metrics Quiz
=============================
As a quiz, let me ask a question
regarding the spinlock performance
objectives and accompanying performance
metrics, which is discussed.
Among the performance metrics
that we just discussed,
are there any conflicting goals?
In other words, does one of these goals
counteract any of the other ones?
I'm giving you three possible answers,
that one conflicts with two,
that one conflicts with three, and
that two conflicts with three.
You should check all
the ones that apply.

25 - Conflicting Metrics Quiz Solution
======================================
The goal number one is to reduce
latency, and this implies that we want
to try to execute the atomic
operation as soon as possible.
As a result, the locking operation will
immediately incur an atomic operation
and that can potentially create some
additional contention on the network.
Therefore one conflicts with three
is one of the correct answers.
Similarly with two, if we want to reduce
the waiting time to delay, then we have
to make sure we're continuously spinning
on the lock as long as it is not
available, so that we can detect as soon
as possible that the lock is freed and
we can try to acquire it.
Again, this will create contention and
so two is conflicting with three.
As for any conflicts between
reducing latency and
reducing waiting time or delay, it is
hard to answer this in a general case.
It will really depend on from
one algorithm to another.
So we're not going to mark this
answer as a conflicting one.

26 - Test and Set Spinlock
==========================
Let's look at this simple spinlock
implementation we showed earlier in this
lesson that uses
the test-and-set instruction.
In this one and in all of the other
examples that we will show, we will
assume that the lock initialization
step sets the lock to be free, and
that 0 indicates free and 1 indicates
busy, that the lock is locked.
The nice thing about this lock is that
the test-and-set instruction is a very
common atomic construction that
most hardware platforms support it.
So, as code, it will be very portable.
We will be able to have the exact
same code run on different hardware
platforms.
From a latency perspective,
this spinlock implementation
performs as good as it gets.
We only execute the atomic operation and
there's no way we can do
any better than this.
Note the lock was originally free.
Say it was 0.
And then as soon as we execute
this spinlock_lock operation,
we make an attempt to
execute test_and_set.
The lock is free, so this will return 0.
As a result of that,
we will come out of this while loop.
And also the test_and_set will
change the value of lock to 1, so
the lock is busy.
So at that point, we have clearly
come out of the while loop.
We're not spinning,
and we have the lock,
and we have marked
that the lock is busy.
Regarding delay,
this particular implementation
potentially could perform well
because we see that we're continuously
just spinning on the atomic instruction.
As long as the lock is busy,
test_and_set will return a 1,
will return busy, so
we will remain in this while loop.
However, whenever the lock does become
freed, this test_and_set will, or
at least one of them,
will immediately detect that and
will come out of the while loop.
That single successful test_and_set
operation also will again set the value
of lock to 1, so any other test_and_set
attempts will result in spinning again.
Now, we already said there is a conflict
between latency and delay and
contention, so
clearly this lock will not perform
well from a contention perspective.
As long as they're spinning,
every single processor will repeatedly
go on the shared interconnect,
on the shared bus to the memory
location where the log is stored,
given that it's repeatedly trying
to execute the atomic instruction.
This will create contention,
delay the processing that's
carried out on other CPUs.
It will delay the processing that
the lock owner needs to perform,
who's trying to execute
the critical selection.
And so, therefore,
it will also delay the time when
the lock actually becomes freed.
So it's just bad all over.
The real problem with this
implementation is that it continuously
spins on the atomic construction.
If we don't have cache coherence,
we will really have to go to memory in
order to check what is
the value of the lock.
But with this implementation,
even if we do have coherent caches,
they will be bypassed because
we're using an atomic instruction.
So in every single spin,
we will go to memory regardless
of the cache coherence.
That clearly is not the most
efficient use of atomics or
of hardware that does have support for
caches and cache coherence.

27 - Test and Test and Set Spinlock
===================================
Let's see how we can fix the problem
with the previous implementation.
If the problem is that all of
the CPUs are repeatedly spinning
on the atomic operation, let's try
to separate the test part which is
checking the value of
the lock from the atomic.
The intuition is that, for the testing,
we can potentially use our caches and
test the cached copy of the lock.
And only if that cached
copy of the lock is
indicating that the lock has changed
its value, that it's cleaned,
only then do we try to actually
execute the atomic operation.
So, here is what the resulting spin
lock, lock operation will look like.
The first part checks
if the lock is busy.
This checking is performed
in the cache value, so
this is the not involving any atomic
operation, we're just checking whether
a particular memory address is set to
one or zero, so it's busy or free.
On a system with caches,
this will clearly hit the cache.
As long as the lock is busy,
we will stay in this while loop,
it will not evaluate the second
part of this predicate.
So if the lock is busy,
this is one, this is true,
the entire predicate is true,
two will go back in the while loop.
What that also means is that as long as
the lock is busy, as long as this part
is true, the test and set, so the atomic
operation, will not be a valued at all.
We will not attempt to execute it.
Now, only when the lock becomes free, so
when this part of the predicate lock
equals busy, when this is not true.
Only then do we try to evaluate
the second part of this predicate,
at that point the test to set operation,
the atomic instruction will be executed
or will be attempted at least, and
then we will see what happens
whether we acquire the lock or not.
So what this also means is we will
try to make a memory reference
since the test and
set performs a memory reference
only when the lock becomes free.
This spin lock is referred to as
the test and test_and_set spinlock.
It is also reference as a spin and
read spinlock,
since we're spinning on the red
value that's in cache, or
spin on the cached values, so because
this is the behavior of the lock.
The Anderson paper uses the spin and
reach term to refer to this lock.
From a latency and
delay time point, this lock is okay.
It's slightly worse than
the test_and_set lock,
because we have to perform this extra
check, whether the lock is busy or
not that hits the cache, but
in principle, it's good.
But, if we start thinking whether or not
we really solved the contention problem
by allowing to spin on the cache, we
realize that this is not quite the case.
First if we don't have a cached
coherent architecture then
every single memory reference will go
to memory, just like with test_and_set.
So there's no difference what so ever.
If we have cache coherence with
right update then it's not too bad.
The one problem is that
all of the processors with
right update will see that
the lock becomes free.
So, regarding the delay.
And so every single one of them will
at the same time try to execute
the test_and_set operation, so
that can potentially be an issue.
Now the worst situation of using this
particular spinlock implementation
is when we have a right
invalidate based architecture.
In this case, every single attempt
to acquire the lock not only that
it will generate contention for
the memory module,
but it will also create
invalidation traffic.
Now when we talked about the atomics,
we said that a one outcome of
executing an atomic instruction,
is that we will trigger the cache
coherence, so the right update or
right invalidate traffic are regardless
of what the situation is.
If we have a right update situation,
that coherence traffic will
update the value of the other caches
with the new value of the lock.
If the lock was busy before
the write update event and
if the lock remains busy
after the right update event.
Great.
No change whatsoever.
That particular CPU can continue
spinning from the cached copy.
However, with the right invalidate, we
will simply invalidate the cached copy.
So it is possible that the lock was
busy before the cache coherence event,
before somebody executed
an atomic instruction.
And if the atomic construction
was not successful,
we're basically continuing to have
a situation in which the lock is busy.
However, as far as the caches
in the system are concerned,
that atomic instruction just invalidated
their cache copy of the lock.
The outcome of that is they
will have to go out to memory,
in order to fetch this copy of lock,
that they want to be spinning on.
So they will not be able to
just spin on the cache copy,
they will have to go ahead and
fetch this lock value from memory,
every single time somebody attempts
to perform an atomic instruction.
So this type of behavior will simply
just compound the contention effects and
will make performance worse.
The reason basically for the poor
performance of this lock is that,
at the same time, everybody will see
that the lock has changed it state so
that it has been freed.
And, everyone will also at the same
time, try to acquire this lock.

28 - Test and Test and Set Spinlock Quiz
========================================
Let's look some more into
the implications of the test and
test_and_set spinlock implementation.
Here is the question.
In an SMP system with N processors,
what is the complexity of the memory
contentions, relative to the number
of processors, that will result
from the test and test_and_set
spinlock when the lock is freed?
I would like for you to write the O of n
complexity for a system that has cache
coherence with a write-update and also
cache coherence with write-invalidate

29 - Test and Test and Set Spinlock Quiz Solution
=================================================
If caches are write-updated, then all
of the processors will be able to see
when the lock is released immediately,
and they will issue
a test_and_set operation.
So, we'll have as many memory references
as there will be
test_and_set operations,
so the complexity of the contention
is going to be order of O of N.
If the caches are write-invalidated,
then all of the processor's
caches will be invalidated after
that initial lock release.
For some processors, by the time they
reread the lock value from memory in
order to execute this
part of the predicate,
the lock will already have been
set to busy by another processor.
So those processors will try to
spin on the newly read cached copy.
So back in this portion
of the while loop.
Other processors, however, when they
reread the value of lock from memory,
that will happen before any
test_and_set has executed.
So they will see the value
of lock is free.
As a result, they will try to
execute that test_and_set operation.
Now, only one of these test_and_set
operations will succeed.
However, every single one
of them will go ahead and
invalidate everybody's caches.
That means that that
will also invalidate
the caches on those processors that
did see that the lock was busy.
For this reason, the complexity of the,
the input that gets created,
of the contention that gets created
when the lock is freed using that
test _and_set spin
lock is O of N squared.

30 - Spinlock “Delay” Alternatives
==================================
A simple way to deal with
the problems of the test and
test and
set lock is to introduce a delay.
Here's a simple implementation
which introduces a delay
every single time a thread
notices that the lock is freed.
So the delay happens after release.
When the thread sees
that the lock is freed,
we'll come out of this while loop.
And then before going back to recheck
what the value of the lock is and
if it's indeed free to try to
execute the atomic operation,
the test and set, the thread will
wait a little bit, will delay.
The rationale of this is yes,
everybody will see that the lock
is free at the same time.
However, with this delay,
not everybody will try to issue
the atomic operation at the same time.
As a result, the contention in the
system will be significantly improved.
When the delay expires,
the delayed threads will try to
recheck the value of the lock.
And it's possible that if somebody
else in the meantime came and
executed the test and set, it's possible
they will see that the lock is busy.
And then they will go in this inner
while loop and continue spinning.
If the lock is free, the delayed thread
will execute the atomic operation.
However with this delay it's
more likely that not all
the threads will try to execute
the atomic operation at the same time.
And also that we're not going to
have these situations where threads
are repeatedly invalidated while they're
attempting to spin on the cached value.
That is because after
the delay in the second check,
a lot of the threads will see that
this lock has become busy already.
And they will not even attempt
to execute the test and and
set instructions.
So, it'll be fewer cases
where the lock is busy and
somebody's attempting to execute
the test and set instruction.
And that was what caused one of
the issues with the contention effects
in the previous examples.
From a latency perspective,
this spinlock is still okay.
Yes, we do have to perform one memory
reference to get the lock first
into the cache, and
then perform the atomic instruction.
But that's similar to what we saw
with the test and test and set.
From a delay perspective, clearly,
this lock will be much worse,
because once the lock is freed, then we
have to delay for some amount of time.
And if there's no contention for
the lock,
then that delay is just waste of time.
Another variant of the delay-based
spinlocks is to introduce a delay after
every single lock reference.
So every time we go through this
while loop, we include a delay.
The main benefit of this is
that it works in non-cache
coherent architectures.
Because basically we're not
going to be spinning constantly.
In every single spin loop,
we will include a delay.
So if we don't have cache coherence and
we have to go to memory, using this
delay will help with the reduction
of contention of the memory network.
The downside of this is clearly that
it will hurt the delay much more.
Because we're basically building up the
delay even when there is no contention
on the network.

31 - Picking a Delay
=====================
One issue with the delay based spinlocks
is how to pick a good delay value.
Two basic strategies make sense.
Static delay and a dynamic delay.
For static delay, we can use
some fixed information like for
instance the CPU ID,
where the process is running.
In order to determine
a delay that will be used for
any single process that ends up
running on that particular CPU.
The benefits of this is that it's
a simple approach, and under high loads,
likely this static delays will
sort of nicely spread out
all of the atomic references so
that there's no contention.
Clearly, the delay will have to be
a combination of something that
combines this fixed information and
the length of the critical section.
So that one process is delayed
one times the critical section,
another process is delayed twice
the critical section and so forth.
The problem is that this will create
unnecessary delay under low contention.
So what if we have two processes?
The first process is running
on CPU with an ID one.
The second process is running
on a CPU with an ID 32, and so
they're the only two that are contending
for the spin lock, and yet the second
process that's running on the CPU with
ID 32 will be delayed substantially,
regardless of the fact that there
is no contention for the lock.
So to avoid this issue, a more popular
approach is use dynamic delay and
that they named the delay such that
each process will pick a random delay
value based on the current perception
of the contention in the system.
The idea is that the system is
operating in a mode of low contention
then it will choose dynamic delay
value that's within a smaller range.
So it will back off just for
a little bit,
it will delay just for a little bit.
And if the system is opening
in a mode of large contention,
then this delay range
will be much larger.
So with the random selection, some
processes will back off a little bit.
They'll delay a little bit.
Whereas other processes will back off,
they will delay for quite a bit of time.
Theoretically both of these approaches
under high load will result into
the same kind of behaviors.
So dynamic will at high load will
tend to be equivalent to
the static delay based approach.
The key question is, however,
in this Dynamic Delay is
how do we know how much contention
is there in the system?
That's why we put here
the term perceived.
We don't know exactly what is
the contention in the system.
So each of the processes,
the implementation of the spinlock.
Somehow has to infer whether the system
is operating in low or high contention,
so that it can pick
an appropriate delay.
So a good metric to
estimate the contention,
is to track the number of
failed test and set operations.
If a test and set operation fails,
the more likely it is that there
is a higher degree of contention.
The problem with this, however, is if
we're delaying after every single log
reference, then our delay will
keep growing based on both
whether there is indeed contention in
the system, or if simply the owner
of the critical section is delayed or if
it's executing a long, critical section.
So then we may end up with
the same situation as before.
Just because somebody was executing
a long, critical section while holding
the spin log, that doesn't mean
that we need to bump up the delay.
So we need to be able to
guard against this case.

32 - Queueing Lock
==================
The delay alternatives in the spinlock
implementations that we saw in the last
morsel address the problem that
everybody tries to acquire
a spinlock at the same time
when that lock is freed.
In this paper, Anderson proposes
a new lock called a queuing lock,
and that lock is trying
to solve the problem that
everybody sees that the lock
is free at the same time.
If we solve this problem, if not
everybody sees that the lock is free,
then we're essentially also
solving the second problem,
because then not everybody will try
to acquire the lock at the same time.
So let's take a look at
what this lock looks like.
The queuing lock looks as follows.
It uses an array of flags,
with up to N elements where N is
the number of processors in the system.
And every single one of the elements
will have one of two values,
either has-lock or must-wait.
In addition, we will have two pointers.
They will indicate
the current lock holder, so
that one clearly will
have a value of has-lock.
And they will also indicate the index
into this array that has the last
element on the queue.
When a new thread arrives at the lock,
it will get a ticket and
that will be the current position
of the thread in the lock.
This will be done by adding it after
the existing last element in the queue.
So basically the queue last
value will be incremented and
the new thread will be assigned
the next position in the array.
Since multiple threads may be arriving
at the lock at the same time,
we will clearly have to
make sure that the way that
this queue last appointer is
incremented is done atomically.
So basically this queuing clock depends
on some support for an atomic read and
increments.
It will rely on that kind of
hardware atomic operation.
This is not as common
as test-and-set that we
used in the previous
spinlock implementations.
For each of the threads that
are arriving at this queuing spinlock,
the assigned element of this
flags array, the queue[ticket],
that acts like a private lock.
What that means is that as long as
the value of queue[ticket] is must-wait,
then the thread will have to
spin just like with a spinlock.
When the value of this
element becomes has-lock,
that will be an indication that the lock
is free and you can go ahead and
proceed and enter the critical section.
When a thread completes
the critical section and
needs to release the lock,
it needs to signal the next flag in this
queuing array that it
currently has the lock.
So these are the steps that control who
gets to execute and what needs to happen
when a critical sections is complete and
a lock needs to be released.
Other than the fact that this lock
requires some support for some read and
increment to be performed atomically,
clearly it's going to require a size
that is much larger than the other
spinlock implementations.
All other locks we saw needed
only one memory location to
keep the spinlock information whether
the spinlock is free or busy.
And here we need N such locations
to keep the values has-lock or
must-wait for
each of the elements in this array.

33 - Queueing Lock Implementation - lang_en
==========================================
Here is the implementation of
the queuing lock or the so
called Anderson lock.
The lock is an array and the array
elements have values has lock or
must wait.
Initially the first element of
the array has the value has lock and
all the other elements
have the value must wait.
Also part of the lock structure
is the global variable queuelast.
To obtain a ticket
into this queueing lock
a process must first perform a read and
increment atomic operation.
That will return the myplace so
the index into that particular
process into the queue.
The process will then continue
to spin on the corresponding
element of the array as long
as its value is must-wait.
For the very first thread
that arrives at this lock,
the value of flags of zero will
be has-lock, so that one will
successfully acquire the lock and
proceed in the critical section.
Every subsequent thread, as long as the
first thread is in the critical section,
will come and
will get tickets that will point to some
elements of the flags array that
are from zero to p minus one.
And they will not be able to proceed,
their value will be must-wait.
When the owner of the lock is done with
the critical section, it will reset its
element in the array, you must wait
in order to get this build ready for
the next threads and next processes
that try to acquire this lock.
Notice that we're using some modular
math in order to wrap around this index
read in increment and
just continue increasing the value
queuelast where as our
array's of limited size.
Releasing the lock means that we
need to change the value of the next
element in the array.
So myplace+1, we will change its value
from must-wait, it will become has-lock.
That means that that thread,
that process,
will now come out of
the spin loop that it's in.
Notice that the atomic in this spin
lock implementation involves a read and
increment on a variable, queuelast.
All of this spinning disc implementation
happens on completely different
variables.
So, the elements of the flags array.
For this reason, issuing the atomic
operation, read an increment.
Any kind of invalidation
traffic is not going to concern
any of the spinning on
the elements of the flags array.
These are two different memory
locations, two different variables.
From a latency perspective, this lock is
not very efficient, because it performs
a more complex atomic operation,
the read and increment.
This read and increment operation takes
more cycles than an atomic test and set.
In addition, it needs to perform
this modular shift in order to
find the right index into the array.
All of that needs to happen before
it can determine whether or
not it has to spin or
be in the critical section.
So the latency is not good.
The delays really good however
when a lock is freed, the next
processor to run is directly signaled
by changing the value of its flag.
Since we're spinning on different
locations, we can afford to spin all
the time, and therefore we can notice
that the value has changed immediately.
From a contention perspective,
this lock is much better than any of the
other alternatives that we discussed.
Since the atomic is only
executed once up front and
it's not part of the spinning code.
Plus, the atomic instructions and
the spinning
are done on different variables, so
the invalidations that are triggered by
the atomic will not affect the processor
stability to spin on local caches.
However, in order for
us to achieve this,
we have to make sure that first we
have a cache coherent architecture.
If we don't have cache
coherent architecture,
this spinning has to happen on
potentially remote memory refer.
Second we also have to make
sure that every element
is in a separate cache line.
Otherwise when we change the value
of one element of the array,
we will invalidate
the entire cache line so
we will invalidate potentially
the caches of the other
elements in the array of the processors
that are spinning on other elements.
And that's clearly not
something we want to achieve.
To summarize the benefits of this lock,
come from the fact that it addresses
the key problem that we mentioned with
the other spin lock implementations.
In that everyone saw hat the log
was free at the same time and
everyone tried to acquire
the lock at the same time.
The queue in lock solves that problem.
By having a separate, essentially
a private, lock in this array of locks,
only one thread at a time sees
that the lock is free, and
only one thread at a time
attempts to acquire the lock.

34 - Queueing Lock Array Quiz
=============================
Assume we are using the Anderson's
queueing spinlock implementation
where each array element can have
one of two values: has-lock, and
let's say that's zero, and must-wait,
let's say we use one for that.
Now if a system has 32 CPUs,
how large is the array data structure
that's used in the queueing spinlock?
Your choices are 32 bits,
32 bytes or neither.
Choose the correct answer.

35 - Queueing Lock Array Quiz Solution
======================================
The correct answer is neither.
Remember that for the queuing
implementation to work correctly
each of the elements of the array
has to be in a different cache line.
So the size of the data structure
depends on the size of the cache line.
For example, on my machine,
the cache line is 64 bytes so,
the size of the data structure
will be 32 by 64 byte.
But in practice, there may be other
cache line sizes that are used
on the architectures that you use.

36 - Spinlock Performance Comparisons
=====================================
Then finally, let's take a look at one
of the results from the performance
measurements that are shown
in the Anderson's paper.
This is Figure 3 from that paper
if you're following along.
This figure shows measurements
that were gathered from
executing a program with
multiple processes.
And each process executed
a critical section,
the critical section was executed
in a loop 1 million times.
The number of processes
in the system was varied
such that there is only
one process per processor.
In the platform that was used,
was a Sequence Symmetry
that had 20 processors.
So that's why the maximum number
of processes was also kept to 20.
Also this platform was cache
coherent with write and validate.
The metric that was computed based
on the experiments was the overhead
that was measured compared to
in a case of ideal performance.
An ideal performance corresponded in
these measurements to
a theoretical limit.
How long it takes to execute that
fixed number of critical sections.
So basically there is no contention,
no effects due to the fact that
each of these critical sections
needs to be locked and unlocked.
Then how long would it take to run
these number of critical sections.
The measured difference between that
theoretical limit and whatever it
actually took to perform this
experiment was considered the overhead.
And this is what these graphs represent.
These experiments were performed for
every one of the different spinlock
implementations we discussed.
From the spin on read,
the test_and_test_and_set,
all the way to the queuing
implementation.
These results don't include
that the basic test and
set when we're spinning on
the atomic construction.
Basically that implementation would
result in something that would just
completely be off the charts.
It would be the highest overhead
the worst performance measurement.
And then, notice how we have for
the different variations of the delay
both the static and the dynamic delay.
So let's see what
happens under high load.
This is where we have lots of processors
and lots of processes running on those
processors that are contending for
the log.
We see from these measurements that
the queuing log, it's the best one.
It is the most scalable and as we add
more and more processors, more and
more load, it performs best.
The test_and_test_and_set log,
that's this line here,
that one will perform worst.
That isn't particular the case, because
here we have an architecture that's
cache coherent with right invalidate.
And we said that in that case,
on release of the test_and_test_and_set
log, we have an order of n
squared memory references.
So a very high contention
on the shared bus and
that's going to really hurt performance.
After delay based alternatives,
we see that the static implementations
are a little bit better than
their dynamic counterparts.
Since under high loads with static,
we end up nicely balancing
out the atomic constructions.
First with dynamic,
we still end up with some randomness,
with some number of collisions.
Those are avoided in the static case.
Also note that delaying after every
single memory reference is slightly
better than delaying after the log
is freed only, it's only on release.
Because when we avoid
after every reference,
we end up avoiding some
additional invalidations
that come from the fact that sequence
is a right invalidate architecture.
Under light loads, when we have few
processes then few processors as well,
we can make couple of observations.
First we see that test_and_set performs
really pretty well in this case.
And that's because this implementation
of a spinlock has low latency.
We were just performing a check,
if lock equal busy and then we were
moving on to the atomic test_and_set.
We also see that in terms
of the delay alternatives,
the dynamic delay alternatives.
The backup delay alternatives
perform better than the static ones.
And that is because with
the dynamic alternatives,
we end up with lower delay.
But we said that static alternatives
can lead to situations in which the two
processors that have the extreme,
the smallest and the largest delay.
Are the only ones that are contending on
the lock and so we have wasted cycles.
We also see that under light loads,
the queueing lock performs the worst.
This is the performance
of the queueing lock.
And the reason for that is we
explain that with the queuing clock,
we have pretty high latency.
Because we need to implement
the read and increment and
the modular processing, etc.
So this is what hurts the performance
of the queueing lock under light loads.
One final comment regarding
the performance results that
we just discussed is that
this points to the fact.
That with system design, there isn't
really a single good answer that
the design points should be driven
based on the expected workload.
Light loads, high loads,
architectural features,
number of processors,
write invalidate, write update, etc.
The paper includes additional
results that point to some of
these trade offs in more detail.spi

37 - Lesson Summary
===================
In this lesson, we talked about
other synchronization constructs
beyond just mute excess and
condition variables.
And described some of
the synchronization problems that
these constructs are well suited for.
In addition, we talked about the
spinlock alternatives that are described
in Anderson's paper.
And learned how hardware support,
specifically how atomic instructions
